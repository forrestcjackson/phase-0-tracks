# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows someone to save multiple versions of a file. It's important because with it, we can see what changes we made and when, as well as being to roll back and edit previous copies of a file or files.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the files you're working on that can be independently edited and later merged to the master branch. You can use them when you need multiple people doing separate tasks on a project, or if  you wanted to organize the changes you're making.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you record a change you've made in a repository. A good message would include what all was changed in the commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when the same line of code are edited on different branches, and then attempted to merge onto the same branch.
